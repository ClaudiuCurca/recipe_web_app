## Recipes Web Application
Welcome to my Recipes Web Application repository! This project was created with the primary goal of helping me practice using NextJS and GraphQL. Let's explore the key features and technologies used to bring this application to life:

## Key Features

**Search, Add, Edit, and Delete Recipes:** This web app allows users to easily search for recipes, add their own culinary creations, edit existing recipes, and even delete recipes when needed.

**User Authentication with NextAuth:** I've integrated NextAuth, which provides authentication with Google. Users can log in using their Google accounts. 

**Seamless Frontend with Next.js and TypeScript:** Leveraging the power of Next.js, I tried to create server-side-rendered (SSR) components that offer optimal performance and enhanced SEO capabilities. I also created reusable components such as Recipe Form which is used both for adding and editing recipes, and Recipe cards which are used on a lot of pages of the application.

**Serverless GraphQL Backend Powered by Grafbase:** I've utilized Grafbase, a serverless GraphQL backend service. 

**Tailwind CSS:** For styling I've used Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind's intuitive classes and responsive design capabilities allowed me to craft an appealing layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
